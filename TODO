On-device service capabilities:

Client:

  * Bug: stack frame unwind cannot parse ISRs due to gcc's bug in recording reg saves
    and calculating CFA re SREG. (see below)
  * Ability to show local variables within stack frame.
  * add notion of "current frame" that can be adjusted rather than just as immediate arg
    to `frame` / `\f`
  * Link type information for methods & variables to Symbols in Debugger initialization
    after parsing dwarf_info().
  * types.py should handle union type? bit fields?
  * Filter __dbg_service and __vector17 out of stack trace report and `frame` commands?


SAM D21 support: (See Cortex-M0+ Technical Reference Manual)
* Breakpoint unit support
* Watchpoint unit support
* Single-step support
* ... cleaner backtrace via ARM-standard frame pointer record walking.
