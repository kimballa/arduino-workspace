On-device service capabilities:

Client:
  * bug: MethodInfo seems to have all formals added twice?
      load read_byte.dump; locals 3

  * Even if we can't add brand new breakpoints at arbitrary locations, we can at least
    control/suppress existing ones.
    - Server could have a memory array for $PC values we /don't/ stop at. If $prevPC
      is on the list, don't actually go into the service.
    - Could maybe also manage this client-side; higher-latency, but would have unlimited
      memory for bp suppressions and possibly less brittle asm work.
  * Can we implement a 'setlocal' ?
    * Would need to use call frame info to determine where on the stack it lives...
      or where on the stack frame above the local the register got saved.

  * add notion of "current frame" that can be adjusted rather than just as immediate arg
    to `frame` / `\f`
  * Link type information for methods & variables to Symbols in Debugger initialization
    after parsing dwarf_info().
  * types.py should handle union type? bit fields?
  * Filter __dbg_service and __vector17 out of stack trace report and `frame` commands?

  * Optionally embed ELF file in core dump file, for all-in-one dump file w/o separate .elf.
  * Use image dumps for integration testing.

SAM D21 support: (See Cortex-M0+ Technical Reference Manual)
* Breakpoint unit support
* Watchpoint unit support
* Single-step support
* ... cleaner backtrace via ARM-standard frame pointer record walking.
