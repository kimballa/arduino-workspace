On-device service capabilities:

Client:

  * repl should use a custom @cmd attr that declares the keywords for each method,
    and the cmd map should be built up automatically.
  * repl `help` should build the command text dynamically through the @cmd attrs
    and the first non-empty line of each command func's __doc__ string.
  * readline autocompleter 
    - command names
    - symbols
  * add notion of "current frame" that can be adjusted rather than just as immediate arg
    to `frame` / `\f`
  * Link type information for methods & variables to Symbols in Debugger initialization
    after parsing dwarf_info().
  * types.py should handle union type? bit fields?
  * Filter __dbg_service and __vector17 out of stack trace report and `frame` commands?

SAM D21 support: (See Cortex-M0+ Technical Reference Manual)
* Breakpoint unit support
* Watchpoint unit support
* Single-step support
* ... cleaner backtrace via ARM-standard frame pointer record walking.
