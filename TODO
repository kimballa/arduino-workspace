On-device service capabilities:

Client:
  * Extract framebuffer records from .debug_info
    * Implement FBREG expr operation
  * Can we implement a 'setlocal' ?
    * Would need to use call frame info to determine where on the stack it lives...
      or where on the stack frame above the local the register got saved.
  * Lots of methods named None. Data parse error? Or just need to clean up formatting?
  * Some formal args don't have names and report "void foo(<sometype> None, ...)"
    Get the name? At minimum, clean up the formatting?

  * add notion of "current frame" that can be adjusted rather than just as immediate arg
    to `frame` / `\f`
  * Link type information for methods & variables to Symbols in Debugger initialization
    after parsing dwarf_info().
  * types.py should handle union type? bit fields?
  * Filter __dbg_service and __vector17 out of stack trace report and `frame` commands?

SAM D21 support: (See Cortex-M0+ Technical Reference Manual)
* Breakpoint unit support
* Watchpoint unit support
* Single-step support
* ... cleaner backtrace via ARM-standard frame pointer record walking.
