Makefile:
------------

* The special 'core' rules work if you run `make` twice, but on a cold start from a `make clean`
  it fails. You then need to `make` again for it to work.

Debugger:
------------


callstack walking /sorta/ works? initially, anyway?
- initial callstack on dbg_break @ start works
- later callstack traces after continuing + a later interrupt don't seem to work right
  ... often it's just "empty stack."
  ... at some point I got a new valid stacktrace but it was incomplete.

- and there's still the makefile b.s.


On-device service capabilities:
  * callstack walking
  * MEMSTATS (can this be done w/o incl'ing malloc?)
  * gpio in/out

Client:
  * Read ELF file and load symtab
  * Search symtab for mangled symbol
  * Connect to debugger
  * Read global var by sym
  * Write global var by sym
  * Deconvolve stacktrace addr's to fn names (and display args?)
  * 'help' text
  * Interact w/ all device service capabilities

SAM D21 support: (See Cortex-M0+ Technical Reference Manual)
* Breakpoint unit support
* Watchpoint unit support
* Single-step support
