Debugger:
------------

On-device service capabilities:
  * annotate more debugger methods with no_instrument.

Client:
  * Read ELF file and load symtab
  * Search symtab for mangled symbol
  * Connect to debugger
  * Read global var by sym
  * Write global var by sym
  * Deconvolve stacktrace addr's to fn names (and display args?)
    ... use addr2line(1) ?
    See https://balau82.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/trace-and-profile-function-calls-with-gcc/
    ... we should probably be recording the caller addr not (just) the callee method.
    (only method you don't get that way is the leaf; but maybe we can pull the RETI target
    from the ISR or __dbg_break() with some clever asm that knows the specific fn well.)
  * 'help' text
  * Interact w/ all device service capabilities

SAM D21 support: (See Cortex-M0+ Technical Reference Manual)
* Breakpoint unit support
* Watchpoint unit support
* Single-step support 
* ... cleaner backtrace via ARM-standard frame pointer record walking.


Current stats: 9660 data, 514 RAM
    9714 / 514 (wdt.h, reset)
    9826 / 514 (length byte and STACKREL)
    9880 / 514 (poke)
    12016 / 576 (stacktrace) <<*with instrumentation; 9998/534 without>>
    11750 / 546 (gpio; more selective stacktrace instrumentation; *10114/534)
    11838 / 552 (memory usage reporting; *10192/540)


empty program:  3896 / 150
with dbg-gpio:  5564 / 173 (+1668)
instrumented:   5900 / 173
dbg-memusage:   5952 / 179 (*5618/179)

Minimum debugger o.h. is 1722 flash, 29 sram (without instrumentation). 
Minimum instrumentation is +334 bytes (~6%), including tiny user program.
