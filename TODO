On-device service capabilities:

Client:

  * bug: `type <someobj>` says the type is <someobj>. see e.g `type lcd` it reports `lcd: lcd`,
    not the class name.
  * add notion of "current frame" that can be adjusted rather than just as immediate arg
    to `frame` / `\f`
  * Link type information for methods & variables to Symbols in Debugger initialization
    after parsing dwarf_info().
  * types.py should handle union type? bit fields?
  * Filter __dbg_service and __vector17 out of stack trace report and `frame` commands?

SAM D21 support: (See Cortex-M0+ Technical Reference Manual)
* Breakpoint unit support
* Watchpoint unit support
* Single-step support
* ... cleaner backtrace via ARM-standard frame pointer record walking.
